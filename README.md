# Marketing-Agency-Site

## Description

For this project, I set out to design a marketing agency website. I edited the pre-existing code to correctly structure and format the codebase for the website. This allows the code to be more readable and better structured. I also added "alts" to the images so that if they do not load properly it describes the pictures. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You can find the project here: https://trlivenp.github.io/Marketing-Agency-Site/

When you first open the website you will see a screen alike the one pictured below. This website displays what the company stands for, and features a nav bar that assists the user in navigating the website.
